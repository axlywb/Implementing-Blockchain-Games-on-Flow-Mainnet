# Implementing Blockchain Games on Flow Mainnet

deploying a blockchain game on Flow Mainnet, requires creating and managing smart contracts in Cadence, Flow's official programming language. Here just give a simple example by creating a smart contract to store player scores and two functions for it
1. increase score and
2. get the player's score.

# Initializing Connection with Flow Blockchain

# Reading Data from Flow Blockchain

# Writing Data to a Blockchain Stream

# Smart Contract di Cadence

# Implementation of Smart Contracts in Unity

Make sure to change placeholders such as node addresses, access keys, account addresses, and so on according to the actual configuration and data you have.

that this is a simple example, and further development is needed according to the needs and logic of the project building blockchain game.

As a note,
make sure to design and implement appropriate security functions to protect blockchain data and access.
